Basic info about the project
1. This project is a forked version of a Example Mod Template for Bepinex projects targeting Unity games.
2. The idea is that other mod developers can use this template to mod the game "CloverPit"
3. We are modifying the base Bepinex template to make it specific to CloverPit so that it can be used for future mod developing.

When modifying this template, keep in mind the following:
1. This template is desinged for use with Windows OS only (Including WSL environments)
2. CloverPit is a Unity 6 Game and therefore our dotnet target framework is netstandard2.1
